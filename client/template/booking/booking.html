          <p>We understand if you cannot make it to your appointment, we just ask for notice of your cancellation <strong>at least 15 minutes prior to your appointment</strong>, but preferably more.</p>
          <p>All No Shows will have access to online booking disabled. You will be required to call the salon to book and pre-pay your next appointment</p>
          <p>Customers who are over 10 minutes late to their appointment will not be seen unless it does not interfere with the next client.</p>
          <p>Our policies have been formed with our clients in mind. We are very busy during the school year and each pre-cancellation could be filled with clients on our waiting list or walk-ins.  

We thank you for respecting our policies in advance!</p>
